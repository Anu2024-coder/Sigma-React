React- is a js library for creating UI
creating user interfaces from components(individual reusable pieces of code)
JSX(javascript extension syntax)- is a way of writing html inside js
babel(an internal tool) is used to transpile jsx code to js 

setting up with React
i Create-React-App(older)
ii vite(quicker and faster) (recommended)

jsx expressions must have one parent element

named exports are useful when you want to export multiple values and import them with their specific names,
while default exports are handy for exporting a single value and giving it a custom name when importing. 
The choice between the two depends on the structure and requirements of your codebase.

default import--
import Title from "./Title.jsx";

default export--
export default Title;

Named Export and import--
export {title};
import {title} from "./Title.jsx";

writing markup in jsx
i return a single root element(to return multiple elements from a component,wrap them with a single parent tag like div)
ii close all the tags
iii camelCase most of the things(when giving class to elements we will give className instead of class because class is a reserved word in js)


React fragmant
fragment lets you group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM
<>
<title/>
</>

jsx with curly braces(code embedded in curly braces {} is treated as pure js code)
